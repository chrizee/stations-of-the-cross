                <p><strong>Leader:</strong> We adore Thee, O Christ, and bless Thee.</p>
                <p><strong>All:</strong> Because by Thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>
                <p>As Jesus hung on the cross, he forgave the soldiers who had crucified him, and prayed for his mother and friends. Jesus wanted all of us to be able to live forever with God, so he gave all he had for us.</p>
                <p>Jesus, let me take a few moments now to consider your love for me. Help me thank you for your willingness to go to your death for me. Help me express my love for you!</p>
                <p>My Jesus, three hours didst Thou hang in agony, and then die for me; let me die before I sin, and if I live, live for Thy love and faithful service.</p>
                <p>Our Father.... Hail Mary.... Glory Be to the Father....</p>
                <p>
                   <strong>Leader:</strong> Jesus Christ Crucified <br />
                   <strong>All:</strong> Have mercy on Us. <br />
                   <strong>Leader:</strong> May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, Rest in peace <br />
                   <strong>All:</strong> Amen. <br />
